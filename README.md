# `bftgrid`

An actor-like framework to implement and test distributed protocols.

## TODO before publishing

- [ ] Join support for all concrete actor systems (but do not add at trait level, it's blocking, will break simulation!)
- [ ] Networking
- [ ] Networked multi-node example
- [ ] Multi-node example running both networked and simulated
- [ ] Split/refactor long files/functions
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Docs
- [ ] Unit tests
